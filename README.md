# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction 

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not, using machine learning techniques. The project uses the famous Titanic dataset and implements various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier Ensemble to train a predictive model. 
Random Forest Classifier: For capturing complex non-linear relationships
Logistic Regression: For interpretable linear decision boundaries
Voting Classifier Ensemble: Combines both models for improved accuracy and robustness
