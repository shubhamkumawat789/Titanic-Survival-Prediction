# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not, using machine learning techniques. The project uses the famous Titanic dataset and implements various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to train a predictive model. 

This project is designed to showcase end-to-end data processing, model training, and deployment using **Streamlit** for interactive web applications.

## Objective
- Predict Titanic passenger survival based on features like age, sex, class, and more.
- Implement multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Provide an interactive Streamlit app for making predictions.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Interactive web interface for user inputs and predictions.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.9
- Streamlit
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib
